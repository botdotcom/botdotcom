Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## About Me

### Student and Engineer
I am a Computer Science graduate from San Jose State University, currently working as a Technical Support Engineer at Adobe. I came across this cool README feature on github - kudos for that! I am exploring a few things in the software industry and soon hope to be a part of it again.
